# From 29 April 2021

Peter, proposal:
- have one 'site' per grid cell by discretizing movement OR using NearestNeighborOfPoint
- give each site a composite 'suitability' by multiplying a "topography suitability"
    (obtained from slope & aspect or generated randomly, autocorrelated)
    by a "climate suitability" obtained from glaciers
- make dispersal stick to local features (water and/or suitability) by breaking it into
    several small steps
- do interpolation by computing distance to each boundary... ?
- Q: was current biodiversity shaped by refugia? or, just the landscape?
- Q: is it (really) secondary contact?
- Q: how patchy is the modern distribution? are current populations connected or not?
- Q: how does movement depend on continuous data,
     like how much snow there is present between two sites (measured by SWE)?

# From 22 Apr 2021

- fit maxent models: first one looks pretty good
- CCSM4: 21Kya - a bunch of ice-free patches within the glacier (nunataks) but very inhospitable
- nunataks are with ice on both sides; east of a block of ice
- except there's one larger ice-free patch
- higher-res version has 1km2 pixels
- two time snapshots of high-res; nine of low-res
- deglaciation ends and holocene starts at 10.5Kya (hundreds or 1000 years of deglaciation)
- how to interpolate between old map and new map?

- number of eggs per year: 15-20 (check it with yi-ming)
- females lay eggs once a year
- sex ratio: more females than males, 60/40 (common in beetles) - due to spiroplasma killing males?
- (but also males are bigger and take longer to develop so have higher risk (but not for this species))
- option1: egg laid in summer, overwinters as larvae, reproduces next year
- option2: or overwinters as an adult and reproduces at year 2
- probably reproduce *only once*, with some probability of doing it at year 1 versus 2
- dispersal: area of ideal habitat is like dozens of meters (smaller than a football field),
    not found outside of a few meters outside of the good habitat
- but maybe passive dispersal downstreams - like to walk in streams (and stick to streams)
- juveniles are not found in the field
- rare long distance: down/up streams; occasional long walkabouts of like 500m?
- pop size in a patch: cannibalism, food availability, predation (eg by other Nebria)
- multiple mating
- has rough census size estimates: tens to hundreds up to a thousand
- larvae are sit-and-wait predators in water and also in/under snow
- larvae can float on the water
- larvae live in tunnels


# From 12 April 2021

live above 2900m in vertical seeps

100s to 1000s per site;
0.1 to 0.25 of good sites are occupied;
roughly one site per sq mile in good habitat;
roughly hundreds of square miles of good habitat

one generation = one year
